#3. Write a menu driven program to demonstrate use of list in python.
a.	Put even and odd elements into two different lists.
b.	Merge and sort the two list.
c.	Update first element with X value and delete the middle element of list.
d.	Find max and min element from the list.
e.	Add N names into the existing number list and check if word python is present     in list.
