#Write a Python program to swap two numbers and check if the first number is positive negative or zero.

#CODE
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

temp = num1
num1 = num2
num2 = temp

print("After swapping, the first number is:", num1)
print("After swapping, the second number is:", num2)

if num1 > 0:
    print("The first number is positive.")
elif num1 < 0:
    print("The first number is negative.")
else:
    print("The first number is zero.")




#OUTPUT
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 6
After swapping, the first number is: 6
After swapping, the second number is: 5
The first number is positive.

Enter the first number: 56
Enter the second number: -42
After swapping, the first number is: -42
After swapping, the second number is: 56
The first number is negative.

Enter the first number: 66
Enter the second number: 0
After swapping, the first number is: 0
After swapping, the second number is: 66
The first number is zero.
